# Java_Basics

This repository is created to track the learning process in Core Java.

This github and eclipse is done through eclipse and not through git bash
follow the below steps for future reference

firstly, create a github repository and copy the uri https://github.com/jk-047/Java_Basics.git
next go to eclipse. click on window -> preferences -> GIT -> configuration.
under configuration, we need to add the user name and user email just as in git bash. if they are already present, leave them untouched.

go to help. click on install new software. a window is opened asking the location. click on add. then provide the below details
Name: EGit
Location: https://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates
then click on add button. click on next or add or ok whatever it asks and wait till the software installation is all completed.
once done it will ask to restart the app. click restart and we are good to go.

Now click on window -> show view -> git repositories. after this a small panel will be shown at the bottom left hand side. there click on clone repository.
a dialogue box is opened asking for github or clone uri. click on clone uri. 
paste the uri copied from github repo page in teh dialogue box. rest all fields are auto-filled. click on next next next. if prompted to provide user name and credentials, provide the github email id and passowrd.
if password doesnt work and still asks for user credentials, go to github, click on profile picture, then settings. at the bottom left hand side, there is an option called developer settings. click on that.
click on personal access tokens. then click on generate token. it would ask previlages assigned to the token, and its exipry date. choose all option accordingly and then click ok.

cant paste the token here because the first token created got revoked.

copy this token and save it somewhere because it will not be displayed again. 
now use this token as password when commiting the code in eclpise. Eureka!

messeup previous repo. using this one now.
This folders are from backup.
